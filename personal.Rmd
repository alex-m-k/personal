Alex Kowalski is a PhD candidate in the Institute for Work and Employment Research at the MIT Sloan School of Management. He is also affiliated with Sloan's economic sociology group.

Alex studies worker involvement in the future of work. With the development of new technologies and an ever-changing business environment, firms are faced with numerous opportunities to rearrange work and implement new practices and policies. Empowering workers by including them in decisions surrounding these changes presents both benefits and challenges. Currently, Alex is studying decisions that pertain to the timing, tools, and technologies used to arrange and perform work. His research takes place inside warehouses, which are part of a rapidly evolving sector of the U.S. economy that is employing more people as e-commerce grows yet are also sites where concerns about job quality are central.

Current projects include investigations into:

- Variation in management approaches to work scheduling and their workforce implications
- Temporal precarity, or how schedules differentially impact distinct groups of workers' well-being and turnover
- The benefits of giving workers greater control over their schedules
- Competing approaches to robotic automation in warehouses and their workforce implications
- The challenges of implementing performance pay systems
- The significance of worker identity and value systems in workplace conflict
